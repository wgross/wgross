## Hi, I’m @wgross

I’m interested in 
- dotnet/C# 
- extending PowerShell with scripts and C#

Notable stuff I' presenting here:
- [TreeStore.Core](https://github.com/wgross/TreeStore.Core): as a framework for making PowerShell cmdlet providers (file system)
- [JsonFS](https://github.com/wgross/json-fs): Mount a JSON file in powershell as a drive and apply PowerShells `*-Item` and `*-ItemProperty` commands to it.
- [fswatcher-engine-event](https://github.com/wgross/fswatcher-engine-event): A PowerShell module to deliver filesystem change notifications through PowerShell engine event system
